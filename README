# Real-Time Market Insights Prototype

## Overview

This prototype offers a real-time market insights solution using a blend of Java and Python technologies. It leverages Spring Boot microservices for scalable backend development, integrates Apache Kafka for efficient data streaming, and employs Python for data analysis and machine learning.

## Key Features

- **Integration of Technologies:** Seamlessly combines Java and Python for backend services and data analysis, respectively.
- **Scalable Microservices:** Utilizes Spring Boot microservices for modularity, scalability, and independent development.
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Employs Apache Kafka for efficient handling of high-frequency market data.
- **Data Analysis and ML:** Integrates Python and Jupyter for sophisticated data analysis and machine learning.
- **Security Measures:** Implements robust security measures, including Spring Security, OAuth, and JWT.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Integrates Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD for automated build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Containerization:** Uses Docker for containerization, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Implements Prometheus, Grafana, SLF4J, and Python Logging for comprehensive monitoring.
